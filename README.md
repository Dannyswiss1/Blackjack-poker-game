## Description

This project is a basic implementation of the Blackjack card game. It allows players to start a game, draw cards, and calculates the sum of the cards. The game features a responsive design and provides feedback messages based on the game state.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   `https://github.com/Dannyswiss1/Blackjack-poker-game.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to play the game.

## Game Rules

* The goal of Blackjack is to get a sum of card values as close to 21 as possible without exceeding 21.
* Number cards have their face value, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) have a value of 10, and Aces can be either 1 or 11.
* If the sum of your cards is 21, you have Blackjack and win the game.
* If your sum exceeds 21, you lose the game.
* You can draw additional cards to increase your sum, but be careful not to exceed 21.
  
## Gameplay
1. Click the "START GAME" button to begin a new game.
2. The initial sum and your two cards will be displayed.
3. If your sum is less than or equal to 20, you can click the "NEW CARD" button to draw a new card and increase your sum.
4. If your sum is 21, you win the game.
5. If your sum exceeds 21, you lose the game.
